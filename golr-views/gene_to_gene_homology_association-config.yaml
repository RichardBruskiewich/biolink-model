schema_generating: true
description: A homology association between two genes. May be orthology (in which
  case the species of subject and object should differ) or paralogy (in which case
  the species may be the same)

  description: connects an association to the type of association (e.g. gene to phenotype)
  display_name: association type
- id: relation
  description: The relation which describes an association between a subject and an
    object in a more granular manner. Usually this is a term from Relation Ontology,
    but it can be any edge CURIE.

  description: the subject gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric,
    subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for
    the gene or vice versa
